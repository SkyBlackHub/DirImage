### DirImage

Plugin for Total Commander 5.51 or higher, adds the ability to quickly view directories with images in the form of a thumbnails grid.
Works both in "thumbnail view" mode and through the internal lister.

The plugin only works with folders. When called, it scans the target folder (optionally checking subfolders) looking for image files that have valid extensions (see extensions).
The images found in the folder are displayed page by page in the form of a grid of thumbnails with a size of columns x rows.
